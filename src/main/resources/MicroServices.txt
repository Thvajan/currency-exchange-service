	-Complexity is within the app
In MS
	-Generic problem solution
	-Ex:Load Balancing
	-Complexity between Microservices

Patterns and Technologies in MS:
		Patterns - Makes MicroServices work well together
		Technologies - Libraries and Frameworks to Solve common problems

	Service discovery is a pattern and Eureka helps on that.
	
Rest Vs MS:
